<h1>what is this project</h1>
<p>lets say its a sunday evening , you want to watch a movie but dont know which one well this project comes to the rescue you can filter on fields like actor,genre,etc</p>
<p>and the oh so kind backend will give you the movie you yearn for</p>
<h1>technical</h1>
<p>this is a node.js app which will seed its own db with data coded into it</p>
<p>this is however a pure backend, i have made a front end for this but the quality does not match this project so stay tuned till my exams are over for the front end</p>
<h2>requirements</h2>
